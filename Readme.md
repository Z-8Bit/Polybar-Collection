## Installation

To use these polybars, you need to have [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) installed on your system. Once you have Polybar installed, you can download this repository by running the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/Z-8Bit/polybar-collection.git && cd polybar-collection
```

## Usage

To use one of the styles, navigate to the corresponding folder and copy over the config file. For example, to use the "fruitmonster" style, run the following command:

```
cd fruitmonster
cp config.ini ~/.config/polybar/
polybar &
```
Remember to always rename the .ini file to ``config.ini``
You can customize the polybars by editing the .ini file in each folder.

## Styles

The "fruitmonsters" style features a colourful and playful design.

### Simple

The "simple" style features a basic polybar design just edited with colours and some text to look better. It's a good starter config to configure further.

### Exci

The "exci" style is a modification of my good friend Exigma's polybar config.
